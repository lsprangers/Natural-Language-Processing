create environment:
	1) download anaconda3
	2) create <repo/> folder
	3) clone from GitHub link
	4) conda env create -n <NAME> -f repos/natural-language-processing/environment.yml

how to use:
	- run scripts from terminal... "python path/to/script/script.py"
	- edit/run using IDE (pyCharm is my favorite)
	- run it using some website with some UI that I don't care for

error fixing:
	- I don't make errors

error handling:
	- if you find some errors, handle them correctly and re-push the repo to git so I can replace them

uses:
	- get python/a project onto your computer to force you to learn how to pull/edit/run/code 
		effectively in a team setting that requires you to interact with something being 
		manipulated through multiple users that requires strict version controlling (the 
		problem that git solved, so use it for that purpose)

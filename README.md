_Cup a Code_

**Requirements:**

    > computer
    
    > python & virtual environment for it
        
    > * reddit developer account credentials in a .env 
        file (not uploaded to repo)
        
    > * pypi account credentials in .pyirc file 
        (not uploaded to repo)
    
        
    >     * for these files ensure you do "chmod 600 ~/cup_a_code/.pyirc" to stop others
            from viewing your credentials
**Usage:** 

    > this is a repo for building a module that's 
        uploadable to PyPi, and afterwards someone would 
        be able to easily create a virtual environment 
        with python and pip/conda install this module

**Notes**: 

    > As of 2021-03-20 this is cloneable via git - 
        venv / condavenv create from setup or 
        conda_environment.yml file worked on my mac.

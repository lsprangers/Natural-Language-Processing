**authors:** Bryce Frost & Luke Sprangers

**reason:** Bryce can't code in python

**solution:** tell him he can't do it


**usage:** 

to get: 
    create virtual env w/ python 3.7... in conda use "conda create -n myenv python=3.7"
    conda activate myenv
    pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ cup-a-code-smoot==0.0.1
    pip install praw, gensim==4.0.0.b0, python-dotenv
    python script2_try.py

**notes:**
    My dad just completed the ancestry DNA kit and it says he was like 90% from the Bavarian Forest so naturally this was the next step in dealing with that

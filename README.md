_Cup a Code_

**usage:** 

    this is a repo for building a module that's uploadable to PyPi, and afterwards someone would be able to easily create a virtual environment with python and pip/conda install this module

**notes**: 

    As of 2021-03-20 this is cloneable via git - venv / condavenv create from setup or conda_environment.yml file worked on my mac.
